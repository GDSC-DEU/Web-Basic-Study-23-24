      <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> often abbreviated as JS, is
      a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside
      <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. 99% of websites use
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for webpage
      behavior.[10] Web browsers have a dedicated
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine that executes the client code.
      These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The
      most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time
      compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has
      dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
      functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and
      imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
      (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
      structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
