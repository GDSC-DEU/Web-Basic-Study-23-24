    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core
      technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use
      JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10] Web browsers have
      a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines
      are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular
      runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js. JavaScript is a
      high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
      ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
      object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
      supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It
      has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
      dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
      Object Model (DOM).
